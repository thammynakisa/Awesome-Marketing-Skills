## 🎨 Philosophy: Vibe Designing

Most AI-generated content suffers from "The Slop" — generic layouts, predictable palettes, and a lack of soul. In this hub, we practice **Vibe Designing**:

*   **Sacred Drift Aesthetic**: A design philosophy rooted in warmth, trust, and rhythmic typography.
*   **Mathematical Precision**: Using AI to calculate optimal vertical rhythm, contrast ratios, and layout grids.
*   **Contextual Intelligence**: Agents that research the "Why" before they build the "What."
